We got some problems Boo, and it's the way we move.
we don't ever talk, and I miss seein you.

I have tears on my cheek from the lies you've been told, 
and I'm still feeling lonely with only my pillow to hold.

I have a wiafu problem and it's not zero two.
I think it's the built-in with the curly hair do.

I also have problem with cowboys and guitars,
but that little problem is filled up with scars.

And not to forget the big girl with the heart
it's always on leaky and she remotes me her farts.

but the biggest problem Boo is the way we use our mouths.
all you do is chew on carrots, and all I do it kill myself.

I want to send you word, words I know you've read.
but the fed are up my ass with all this paranoia shit.

I have a little package that I sent you in the mail
I hope you get it quickly before the boxes start to pile.
