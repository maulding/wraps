We got some problems Boo, and it's the way we move.
we don't ever talk, and I miss seein you.

I have tears on my cheek from the lies you've been told, 
and I'm still feeling lonely with only my pillow to hold.

I have a wiafu problem and it's not zero two.
I think it's the built-in with the curly hair do.

I also have problem with cowboys and guitars,
but that little problem is filled up with scars.

And not to forget the big girl with the heart
it's always on leaky and she remotes me her farts.

but the biggest problem I know that we have is
that we are only talking without using out mouths.

i should take all this crank and stay up for a week
and dream with my babies while their bodies sleeps.
