a> Sometimes on notes left in places for kitties
t> little blue men without legs introduce themselves to me
r> I think this man here is a david I know. 
r> either maulding or serfling but the which is untold
r> The clouds are a shuffling wonderful thing
r> but the pictures are the thing that maulding will get brought in to see
a> the x and the y are both of you and I

r> from the book filled with holes our placement is thus
