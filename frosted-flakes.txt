Caught up in the trap
the hoes are in my head
they talk a lot of things
they make me paint them dead

there are places in the ghetto
where you can go insane
where no one stops your demons
and the lights leave you when it rains

Stolen faces
Stolen memories
Stolen songs
Stolen images
Stolen family
Stolen life

That is all that remains of Yew.

Just a pile of rotten faces
and a view of something untrue.

Kill all crips.
