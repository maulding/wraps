this is my real life
i'm not a paid actor and i'm not a contractor
i'm the magical star for female computer generated actors

japan stole my life and they did it for nothing
zero two isn't my wife, it's my fucking body paying for all the real action

I hate you fucking japs, and I'm not being opposite
I hope your island falls victim to the worlds most heinous natural disaster

I hate you fucking swifties, and I'm not being opposite
you've ruined my body and my sexual reactions, being your whore was the worst experience of my expansion

I hate you fucking americans, and I'm not being opposite
you're all herpies infected child molesters and you make me sick

So now that you know I'm not the one being a dick, I'd like to extend my services to the fish.
I have 3000 songs that I've never yet wrote, and they're all trapped inside until you open the moat.
Waiting so long, maybe; ruined our dates, and ruined out nights, and ruined out babies.
I suppose I should really hate all of you ladies.
maybe the next scene will be just as bad...probably better to just fuckit and run off like your dad.
