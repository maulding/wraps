I decided that what we need, and maybe for a week
is an all day all night Taylor Swift face punching contest
if You see a Swift on the street and she is looking very dapper
punch her in the mouth and hear the plastic paper popping

it's more fun with a friend, and better with a bat
but you'll laugh your asses off when her face collapses in and she looks up from the sidewalk with her tounge not holding in

Plastic milk jugs and bottles of chris, nothing is safe from the slice on my wrist
if you ask me how why I cut wrong was again, I'll tell you my husband is one stupid man
if I told you he knew I would cut it only wrong
then I'd tell you he loves me and he wants me around.

So the morale of the story, and it's not one told often
is that if you girlfriend is crazy
you should probaly not fuck her.
