Daddy howard daddy howard i need you right now
my maulding isn't here and i'm lonely cuz of the coward

Oh sweety oh sweety i'm so glad to see you here
I've been missing you so greatly since the last time you came near

(Où est ton mari, putain? Où est ton mari?)
(Is he sick? Is he dead? Is he imaginary in your head?)

Now I know a trick that will make this much more fun
I will put the face of maulding on my daddy who's a john

(Cache ton visage putain! Cache ton visage!)
(when you cheat you husband you are cheating all of us)
